### Introduction

This is a project made as part of an assignment in my second year at the university. 

The project had to be some kind of a game and there had to be two students working together;
one from the orientation to become a UI/UX-designer (which in this case was another student named Monika) who
were supposted to be responsible for the graphics and one from the orientation towards web development who were 
responsible for the logic, which was me. So like 80% of the graphics in this project (background, avatars, fonts etc) 
were made by Monika and the other 20% by me, but I also wrote approximately about 98% of the code.


### Installation

To get the project up and running:

- clone the code
- command **npm install** to install the dependencies
- command **npm start** to start the game


### Technologies used

This project were created with an SDK called Rune, which is a newly developed SDK, from some of 
the teachers at the university from the Media techonoly department, written in object oriented JavaScript.

The game was developed for Electron with Node.js.

We did not get to use other frameworks or libraries, not even Bootstrap, so the only technologies that are
being used is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


### To play the game

Once the game is started use the up and down arrow on the keyboard to navigate through the menu and then press space
to select an option. The "rules" or the instructions for the game can be seen in the menu option "Rules".
